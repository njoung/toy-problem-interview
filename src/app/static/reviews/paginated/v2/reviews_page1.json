After much debate I decided to take my chances on this one, the price is great which also did actually worry me. I received it yesterday and it FAR exceeds my expectations, it's beautiful, LOVE IT. It's very full with 3 layers of tulle and a nice satin finished waistband. My daughter is 1 and has a tiny waist, I thought I would have to take it in when I got it but amazingly it fits her and she has PLENTY of room to grow in it as well. It is pretty long on her right now like a full length tutu but that makes it even prettier on her at this point. As she grows obviously it will become shorter, I can't believe I paid this price for such a cute tutu that she can have and grow into for a few years to come, fantastic.
