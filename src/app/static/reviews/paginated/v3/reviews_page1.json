It is a little on the loose side, but it does stay on. While my little girl is a bit of a tomboy, as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers, she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing. Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure.
